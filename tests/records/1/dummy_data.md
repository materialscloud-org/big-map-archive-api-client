# BIG-MAP Archive live demo

During this demo, I sometimes play a user and sometimes an administrator of the site.

## Account creation

- the user discovers the web site's frontpage
- the user tries to access the list of publications via route "/search"
- the user sends an email for opening an account
- the admin creates the account and informs the user about it
- the user changes his (unknown) account password

## Publication of the first version of a record

- the user logs in
- the user accesses his personal area
- the user saves a record with two attached files
- the user previews the published record
- the user publishes the record

## Publication of the second version of the record

- the user modifies the published record
- the user publishes the second version of the record

## Creation and share of links

- the user creates a link to share his (private) published record with his collaborators
- a collaborator accesses the published record using the link

## Search of published records

- the user searches for a published record

## API

- the user searches for a published record via the REST API
