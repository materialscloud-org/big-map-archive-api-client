# big-map-archive-api-client

## Overview

This repository provides methods to interact with the BIG-MAP Archive's API.

## FINALES server's database back-ups

Comments about entries, titles, service accounts per "campaign":
    - There should be a single entry in the archive per campaign;
    - An entry may have multiple versions, with one version created each time a back-up of the FINALES database occurs;
    - A title should be given to each version of an entry but should remain unchanged across all versions of the same entry;
    - A title should vary from one entry to another and should be unique to a campaign;
    - A single service account (e.g., jane.doe+FINALES_1@xxx.xx) should be used for doing back-ups of a campaign; it becomes the owner of the entry and the linked data files;
    - A single service account can be used for multiple campaigns.
